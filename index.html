        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>At Spice Box, we prioritize customer satisfaction and strive to provide a seamless shopping experience. This Refund and Cancellation Policy outlines the procedures and guidelines that govern the cancellation of orders and the process for requesting refunds. We believe in transparency and want our customers to feel confident in their purchases. If you have any questions or concerns regarding our policies, please do not hesitate to reach out to our customer service team.</p>

    <section class="cancellation-policy">
        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>You can cancel your order within 24 hours of placing it for a full refund. This allows you to change your mind after making a purchase, ensuring that you have the flexibility you need. After the initial 24-hour period, cancellations may incur a fee based on the status of your order. Specifically, if you cancel before the item has shipped, you will receive a full refund. If the order has already been shipped, you may receive a 50% refund if canceled within three days of shipping. Unfortunately, once three days have passed, we cannot process any refunds for cancellations. We encourage you to act quickly if you need to cancel an order.</p>

    <section class="refund-policy">
        <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may request a refund under specific conditions. If you receive a damaged or defective item, please report it to us within 7 days of receipt. We will gladly offer a full refund or replacement for any defective merchandise. If you have simply changed your mind about a purchase, you may request a refund within 14 days of receiving the item. To qualify for a refund, items must be unused and in their original packaging. Refunds will be processed within 7-10 business days after we receive the returned item. We are committed to ensuring that our customers are happy with their purchases and will work diligently to resolve any issues.</p>
